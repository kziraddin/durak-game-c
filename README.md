The given code is an implementation of the Durak game in C. Durak is a popular card game in former Soviet Union countries. The code is designed for a 2-player game, with one player being a human and the other player being the computer.

Here is an overview of the program structure and the functions included:

1. Enums:
   - Rank: Represents the ranks of the cards (SIX to ACE).
   - Suit: Represents the suits of the cards (HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS, SPADES).
   - Color: Represents the color of the cards (RED or BLACK).
   - Location: Represents the location of the cards (HOUSE, COMPUTER, HUMAN, TABLE, GARBAGE, TRUMP).
   - Boolean: Represents boolean values (FALSE or TRUE).

2. Global Variables:
   - gameCounter: Keeps track of the number of games played.
   - trumpCard: Index of the trump card in the Deck array.
   - trumpSuit: Suit of the trump card.
   - turn: Indicates the current turn (COMPUTER or HUMAN).
   - attacker: Indicates the current attacker (COMPUTER or HUMAN).
   - gameOver: Indicates whether the game is over or not.
   - winner: Indicates the winner of the game (COMPUTER or HUMAN).
   - attacks: Array of indexes of cards used for attacks.
   - defenses: Array of indexes of cards used for defenses.
   - tableLevel: Level of attacks and defenses on the table.

3. Structs:
   - Card: Represents a player card with rank, suit, color, and location.

4. Function Declarations:
   - Various utility functions to convert enums to strings and count cards in a location.
   - Functions to initialize the deck, assign cards to players, initialize the trump card, and set the initial turn.
   - Functions to print the deck, game status, and player cards.
   - Functions for computer attacks and defenses.
   - Functions to handle human input, validate moves, and play the human's turn.
   - Functions to play the game, complete cards, clear the table, and check if the game is over.
   - A function to clear the screen.

5. The `main()` function:
   - Initializes the deck, prints the game status, and enters the game loop.
   - In each iteration of the loop, it calls the `playGame()` function and checks if the game is over.
   - Prints the game over message or the updated game status.

Note that some parts of the code are missing, including the implementation of several functions. You would need to complete the missing parts and add the game logic to make the program fully functional.
