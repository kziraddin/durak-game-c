This is my project from Principles of Computer Science (CS_601) at Long Island University Brooklyn in 2021.
The project is about the game of durak (fool). It's a card game. 
I will attach the screenshot from the terminal (command) view. The code has no graphical interface, I've decorated this game in terminal view.
The game has 36 cards. 
From 6 to 10 in numbers, Jack, Queen, King, Ace in Diamond shape in red
From 6 to 10 in numbers, Jack, Queen, King, Ace in Spades shape in black
From 6 to 10 in numbers, Jack, Queen, King, Ace in Heart shape in red
From 6 to 10 in numbers, Jack, Queen, King, Ace in Clubs shape in black
The one card among them has to be selected as a Trump card
